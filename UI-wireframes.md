## STAR Method Guidance (for Resume/CV Generator)
- **Situation:** Brief context for each achievement or role
- **Task:** What needed to be accomplished
- **Action:** What you did, using strong action verbs (led, created, improved, launched, etc.)
- **Result:** Quantifiable benefit or impact (numbers, outcomes)

**CV/CL generation will always:**
- Use action verbs and key skills from the job description as priority
- Structure experience bullets via the STAR method
- Advise the user where manual input is optimal
